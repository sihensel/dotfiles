This repository contains my personal Linux dotfiles.
They are often (speak: all the time) a work in progress and may or may not work for you.

Programs in the screenshot (outdated, will get updated soon):
- Neovim
- Neofetch
- MOC (with the Gruvbox color scheme, based on [this](https://github.com/hringriin/dotfiles/blob/master/moc/themes/hringriin_theme))

My Awesome theme is based on Multicolor from [Awesome Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).

## Installation

Clone the repo into your home directory or download the zip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sihensel/dotfiles.git ~/
```

There is an install script that places symlinks to the local repo. 
You might want to ignore that, this is just for my personal setup.

```bash
~/dotfiles/install.sh
```
